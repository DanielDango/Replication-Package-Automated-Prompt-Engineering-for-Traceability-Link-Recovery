Question: Here are two parts of software development artifacts\.

            \{source\_type\}: '''\{source\_content\}'''

            \{target\_type\}: '''\{target\_content\}'''
            Determine if there is a traceability link between these requirements\. Assess whether the target requirement supports, elaborates on, or is directly related to the source requirement in terms of functionality, implementation, compliance with standards, or specific technical details\. Focus on the alignment of functionalities, adherence to relevant standards or specifications, and the context of memory management or remote management capabilities\. Pay particular attention to whether the target requirement provides additional functionality, clarifies implementation details, or ensures compliance with the same standards as the source requirement\. Consider if the target requirement enhances, complements, or is necessary for the fulfillment of the source requirement in a meaningful way\. Additionally, evaluate if the target requirement introduces new concepts or functionalities that are essential for the source requirement's implementation or operation\.

            Are they related?

            Answer with 'yes' or 'no'\.
