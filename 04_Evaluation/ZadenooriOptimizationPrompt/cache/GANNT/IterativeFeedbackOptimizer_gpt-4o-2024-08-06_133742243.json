Yes: This classification is used when the two artifacts are directly related or dependent on each other.

No: This classification is used when the two artifacts are not directly related or dependent on each other. For instance, if one requirement involves creating a task with specific dates, and another requirement describes the use of a TaskManager class for resource allocation, they are not directly related. The focus of the first is on task creation and time management, while the second is on resource management, which is a separate concern.
