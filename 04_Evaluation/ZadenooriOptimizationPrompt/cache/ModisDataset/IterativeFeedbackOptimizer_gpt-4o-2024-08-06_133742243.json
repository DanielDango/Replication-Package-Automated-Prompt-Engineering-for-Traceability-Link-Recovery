For example, if one requirement specifies the creation of metadata for a data product and another requirement involves the production of that data product, they are likely related. In the examples provided, the requirement to create metadata for each completed Level1A_data product is related to the production of MODIS standard data products, as both involve handling data products and metadata.\\n\\n2. **No**: This classification is used when the requirements are independent or unrelated. For instance, if one requirement involves coding standards and another involves data volume and processing load, they are not directly related. In the examples, the requirement about following coding standards is unrelated to the requirement about data volume and processing load, as they pertain to different aspects of the software development process.\\n\\nExpanded Explanations:\\n\\n- When determining if two requirements are related, consider whether one requirement directly influences or is necessary for the fulfillment of the other.
