Look for explicit mentions of how the target fulfills the source's needs.\\n2. **Functional Area Alignment**: Are both artifacts focused on the same functional area, such as data handling, error management, or user interaction? Consider whether they operate within the same context or domain.\\n3. **Connection to Goals**: Is there a clear and logical connection where the target artifact can be interpreted as a means to achieve the goal set forth in the source artifact?
