Added an additional condition for the scenario where the source content mentions \\\"next assigned flight plan\\\" or \\\"execute the next assigned flight plan\\\" and the target content mentions \\\"execution queue\\\".\\n2. Added a condition to exclude cases where the source content mentions \\\"unassign\\\" and the target content mentions \\\"flight plan queue\\\", unless it's about removing a flight plan from the queue.\\n3.
