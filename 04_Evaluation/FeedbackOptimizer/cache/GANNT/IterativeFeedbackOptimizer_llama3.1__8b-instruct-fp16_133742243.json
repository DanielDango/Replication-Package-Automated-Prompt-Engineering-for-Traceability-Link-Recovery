If the target requirement is unrelated, provides alternative solutions, or contradicts the source requirement, answer 'no'.\\n\\n**Additional Hint:** Pay special attention to keywords related to time and scheduling, such as \\\"start date\\\", \\\"end date\\\", \\\"begin time\\\", \\\"end time\\\", \\\"resource allocation\\\", and \\\"task management\\\". These keywords may indicate a relationship between requirements that involve task creation, tracking, or resource assignment. However, also consider the following:\\n\\n* If the target requirement mentions creating a new task with specific dates (e.g., start and end date), it is likely related to the source requirement if the source requirement mentions keeping track of task times.\\n* If the target requirement involves passing an object to a class constructor or using a specific class for resource allocation, it may indicate a relationship between requirements that involve task management and resource assignment. Conversely, if the target requirement does not mention creating a new task with specific dates but instead focuses on managing tasks (e.g., setting start times, allocating resources), it is likely related to the source requirement if the source requirement mentions keeping track of task times.\\n* Consider the level of abstraction in both requirements. If the target requirement provides more details or specifics about how to achieve something mentioned in the source requirement, answer 'yes'. If the target requirement introduces new concepts or ideas unrelated to the source requirement, answer 'no'.\\n\\nBy considering these additional hints, you can improve your ability to identify traceability links between software development artifacts.\\n\\n</prompt>\\n\\nI made the following changes:\\n\\n1. Added a converse condition for the second hint: if the target requirement does not mention creating a new task with specific dates but instead focuses on managing tasks, it is likely related to the source requirement if the source requirement mentions keeping track of task times.\\n2. Emphasized the importance of considering the level of abstraction in both requirements when determining whether they are related.\\n\\nThese changes should help improve the classification results for traceability link recovery by providing more nuanced guidance on how to analyze the relationships between software development artifacts.\"]"}
