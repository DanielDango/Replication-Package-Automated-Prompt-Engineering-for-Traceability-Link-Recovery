The second requirement suggests that this information about the newly connected UAV can be obtained by sending and receiving properties from the UAV. Therefore, there's an indirect connection between them via the process of obtaining UAV properties.","da623568-e660-3a54-b359-e79a719c7749":"Yes, via equivalence. \n\nThe two requirements describe the same functionality but in slightly different words. They both state that the GCS transmits or forwards UAV coordinates to the Middleware.","a19dd88d-7ce9-39d2-858e-61d2383632e2":"Yes, indirectly. \n\nThe two requirements are related because both involve the GCS transmitting data to the GCSMiddleware.

The second requirement mentions executing predefined missions specified in JSON, which can be seen as a way to implement the concurrent execution of flight plans mentioned in the first requirement.","8a1cfdaf-12ce-39f8-9b02-64633eaa8555":"Yes, via requirement. \n\nThe two requirements are related because they both belong to the same category (\"Mission Planning\") and seem to be connected in terms of functionality. The first requirement mentions executing flight plans for multiple UAVs concurrently, while the second requirement explains how a predefined FlightPattern is expanded into waypoints and synchronization points for each participating UAV. This suggests that the expansion process mentioned in the second requirement might be necessary or related to the concurrent execution of flight plans described in the first requirement.","33bba779-4de9-3059-a441-344918e22b8b":"Yes, via shared concept. \n\nThe two requirements are related because they both deal with the execution of flight plans for UAVs in the context of Mission Planning.

The connection between them is that both relate to the concept of \"multiple\" map types/providers, suggesting a broader support for various mapping options.","86db0f70-b34e-3d0f-a346-3561bae4d21b":"Yes, indirectly. \n\nThe first requirement specifies that the MapComponent should support different types of map layers, which is likely necessary to fulfill the second requirement's demand for displaying a map in the UI with specific features like terrain or satellite views.","114d06e3-147c-3e0d-9ca0-838a43aa484d":"Yes, indirectly. \n\nThe two requirements are related because they both involve displaying information on a map. The first requirement mentions supporting different types of map layers, which could include a layer for displaying UAVs. The second requirement specifically states that the _UIRealTimeFlightView_ shall display an icon on the map for each registered UAV based on its current location. This suggests that the map component (mentioned in the first requirement) is being used to display the UAVs' locations, which implies a connection between the two requirements.","8d70b7dd-c5e9-3a1b-a9ed-4cca29c643dc":"Yes, there is an indirect connection between them.\n\nThe two requirements are related because they both involve displaying information on a map.
