The library's functionality needs to be exposed in a way that allows it to work with multiple languages (NFR 21), which is achieved through the provision of interfaces to SWIG wrappers for dynamic language bindings (SRS 59).","77a5ace8-1232-3834-b8fc-5f3fc995ce57":"After analyzing the given requirements, I would classify the relationship as:\n\n**Indirect via functional requirement**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The first requirement (NFR 21) focuses on exposing library functionality in a way that fits specific implementation languages.\n* The second requirement (SRS 11) describes an API that provides abstract data types to ensure independence of concrete implementations.\n* While NFR 21 is a non-functional requirement, it indirectly influences the design of the API described in SRS 11. A clear and explicit connection between these two requirements would be if NFR 21 directly stated something like \"The library's API shall be designed to fit the metaphors and paradigms of C, Java, and Python.\"\n* However, since there is no such direct statement, we can infer an indirect connection through functional requirement SRS 11. The design of the API (SRS 11) is likely influenced by the need to expose library functionality in a way that fits specific implementation languages (NFR 21).\n\nTherefore, I would classify this relationship as **Indirect via functional requirement**.","2b60753c-13c8-3d0d-bbdd-c5a9fa8986d6":"After analyzing the given requirements, I would classify the relationship as:\n\n**Indirect via Non-Functional Requirement**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* NFR 21 focuses on exposing library functionality in a way that fits specific implementation languages (C, Java, Python). This is a non-functional requirement related to usability and maintainability.\n* SRS 6 emphasizes ensuring that changes to the library won't affect tools or applications based on libwarc. This is also a non-functional requirement related to stability and backward compatibility.\n\nWhile there isn't an explicit connection between these two requirements, they both relate to maintaining a stable and usable library (libwarc). The indirect link lies in the fact that NFR 21's focus on language-specific metaphors and paradigms can contribute to making changes to the library more manageable and less likely to break existing tools or applications, which is what SRS 6 aims to ensure. This connection is facilitated by the non-functional requirements related to maintainability and stability.\n\nTherefore, I classify the relationship as Indirect via Non-Functional Requirement."}
