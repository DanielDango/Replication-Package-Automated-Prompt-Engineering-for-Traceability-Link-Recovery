The action of issuing a \"Program_stop\" suggests a mechanism to halt processing when a critical error occurs.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Traceability**:\n   - **Explicit Reference**: The implementation does not explicitly reference the requirement regarding data volume and processing load. It focuses instead on error handling related to data reading.\n   - **Direct Response**: The implementation does not provide a clear and direct response to the requirement. While it addresses a potential issue in the data processing pipeline, it does not ensure that the data products are produced within the specified volume and load constraints.
