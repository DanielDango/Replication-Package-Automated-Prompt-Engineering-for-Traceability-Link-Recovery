This indicates that there is a system in place to handle multiple flight plans associated with each UAV.\n\nWhile both artifacts relate to the management of flight plans for UAVs, Artifact 1 specifically addresses the action of unassigning a flight plan, while Artifact 2 describes the general state of having pending flight plans. There is a conceptual connection between the two, as unassigning a flight plan would affect the list of pending flight plans, but Artifact 2 does not directly reference or address the specific requirement of unassigning a flight plan.\n\nTherefore, there is no direct traceability link between the two artifacts as defined by the requirement that one must directly address or reference the other.\n\n<trace>no</trace>","6482a284-4b7e-3f0f-8c43-a0310d659948":"To determine if there is a traceability link between the two artifacts, we need to analyze their content.\n\nArtifact 1 specifies a requirement related to the execution of a flight plan, stating that the _VehicleCore_ shall send the next waypoint to the UAV when a flight plan is executed.
