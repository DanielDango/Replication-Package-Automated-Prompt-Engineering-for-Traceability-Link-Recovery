aspect of system operation.\n2. **Direct Interaction**: The target artifact's error reporting mechanism (ccmErrEnq()) is directly related to the functionality described in the source artifact, as it involves reporting non-responsive tasks, which is a requirement outlined in the source.\n3. **Complementary Features**: The target artifact enhances the functionality of the source artifact by providing a centralized error reporting interface that supports the requirement of collecting and reporting task health (TASK_HBEAT) and non-responsiveness.\n\nThus, there is a traceability link between the two artifacts.","ee36ec9d-ed39-307e-bfc6-6339874d1d69":"To determine if there is a traceability link between the two artifacts, we need to analyze their content and context.\n\n(1)

(1) specifies a particular action (recording an error and stopping the Watchdog Timer) when an unrecoverable error occurs, while (2) outlines a broader mechanism for reporting errors.\n\n2. **Implementation of Requirements**: The requirement in (2) does not explicitly mention the action of recording an error to EEPROM or stopping the Watchdog Timer. Instead, it focuses on reporting errors to the ground. However, the error reporting mechanism could be part of a larger system that includes the actions specified in (1).\n\n3. **Direct Addressing**: For a traceability link to exist, (2) must directly address the specific actions outlined in (1). While (2) provides a framework for error reporting, it does not fulfill the specific requirement of recording an error in EEPROM or stopping the Watchdog Timer as stated in (1).\n\nIn conclusion, while both artifacts relate to error handling, (2) does not directly implement or address the specific requirements outlined in (1). Therefore, there is no traceability link between the two.\n\n<trace>no</trace>","33f2f6b2-d27d-3c54-81f5-bb4f8f6bf0b6":"To determine if there is a traceability link between the two artifacts, we need to analyze the content of both requirements.\n\n(1) states: '''The DPU-CCM shall implement a mechanism whereby large memory loads and dumps can be accomplished incrementally.'''\n\nThis requirement indicates that the system must support the ability to handle large memory operations (loads and dumps) in an incremental manner.

This task blocks on a semaphore which is given by ccmCmdEnq(). The ccmCmdTask() wakes on the semaphore and calls ccmCmdProcess() to process waiting commands. The ccmCmdProcess() function subsequently retrieves waiting commands from the Command Queue and invokes ccmCmdDispatch() to verify the expected length of the command and execute it. If command echo is enabled, ccmCmdDispatch() will call ccmHkMkCmdEcho() to blindly echo the command back to the ground. Counts for both rejected and executed commands are maintained. If the command sent to ccmCmdEnq() is either a 1 Hz Clock Time message or an Attitude message from the spacecraft, the command will not be forwarded to the Command Queue, but instead will be executed directly while still in interrupt context. Attitude messages are forwarded to dpaCommandSend(), while the 1 Hz Clock Time message’s parameters are passed to tisTimeSync() in order to synchronize the current time. Any other non DPU or spacecraft observatory messages are quietly discarded without reporting an error. In order to guarantee that ccmCmdTask() task reports in with the CCM Control Task periodically in absence of a ground command, the semaphore has a timeout value of 20 seconds.

(1) specifies that the starting address of the event ring buffer should be set, while (2) describes a task that initializes the TMALI CSC and manages data in the TMALI buffer.\n\n2. **Event Ring Buffer**: (1) explicitly mentions the event ring buffer, while (2) discusses the TMALI buffer and how it interacts with the DCI. The TMALI buffer can be considered a type of event ring buffer since it stores events from the DCI.\n\n3. **Address Storage**: (1) indicates that the starting address of the event ring buffer is stored in TMALI_HK, which implies that the initialization process in (2) must involve setting up this address to ensure proper data handling.\n\n4. **Data Handling**: (2) describes how data is read and stored in the TMALI buffer, which is likely dependent on the correct initialization of the event ring buffer as specified in (1).\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that (1) provides a requirement that is directly addressed by (2) in terms of initializing the event ring buffer and managing data within it.

Requirement (2) does not explicitly mention command counts but focuses on error reporting. However, the process of reporting errors could be related to the commands being processed, as rejected commands may lead to errors that need to be reported.\n\n3. **Reporting Mechanism**: The reporting mechanism in (2) (ccmHkMkError() and the formation of error packets) could potentially include the counts of commands received and rejected as part of the error reporting process.
