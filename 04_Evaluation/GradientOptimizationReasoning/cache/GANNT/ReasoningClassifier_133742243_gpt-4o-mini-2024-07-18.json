This requirement is directly related to the time management aspect of tasks mentioned in (1).\n\nThe key elements in both artifacts are the concepts of \"start date\" and \"end date\" in (1) and \"begin and end times\" in (2).

This suggests a focus on the relationship and management of resources in relation to tasks.\n\nArtifact (2) describes a collection of resource assignments that manage the relationships between human resources and tasks. It specifically mentions functions to add and remove human resource assignments, which aligns with the idea of managing dependencies as described in (1).\n\nBoth artifacts deal with the management of resources in relation to tasks, specifically focusing on adding and removing resources (or assignments) and the relationships between them.

This implies that managing holidays and vacation days is crucial for determining when a person is available.\n\nArtifact (2) describes a function within the human resource class that changes a person's availability based on holidays. This indicates that the system has a mechanism to adjust availability in response to the holiday information.\n\nThe connection between the two artifacts is clear: the first artifact establishes the need to manage holidays and vacation days, while the second artifact implements a function that utilizes this information to adjust availability.

Artifact (1) focuses on the presentation aspect (showing the critical path), while artifact (2) emphasizes the evaluation aspect (calculating or determining the critical path). \n\nSince both requirements are concerned with the critical path and are complementary in nature—one requiring the system to show the critical path and the other requiring it to evaluate it—there is a clear traceability link between them.\n\nTherefore, the answer is <trace>yes</trace>.","2a0723f4-734a-34d0-920b-8e98cc870cde":"To determine if there is a traceability link between the two artifacts, we need to analyze their content and see if they are related in terms of functionality or requirements.\n\nArtifact (1) states that the system should \"maintain task properties\" and specifically mentions the ability to \"edit and update task properties including start and end date, name, or progress (% complete).\" This indicates a broader requirement for managing various properties of a task.\n\nArtifact (2) specifies that the \"GUI should be able to provide the ability to change start/end date of a task.\" This requirement is more specific and focuses on the user interface aspect of changing the start and end dates of a task.\n\nThe key point here is that both artifacts are concerned with the task properties, particularly the start and end dates.
